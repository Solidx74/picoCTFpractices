1.After Downloading the zip file unzip the file by using unzip command in terminal.
2.Then do the following so the terminal will show:
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cd Downloads                                                                                                                                                                    
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ ls
big-zip-files  big-zip-files.zip                                                                                                                                                                  
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ cd big-zip-files                                                                                                                                                                
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads/big-zip-files]
└─$ grep -r pico    
folder_pmbymkjcya/folder_cawigcwvgv/folder_ltdayfmktr/folder_fnpfclfyee/whzxrpivpqld.
txt:information on the record will last a billion years. 
Genes and brains and books encode picoCTF{gr3p_15_m4g1c_ef8790dc}
3.As you can see we got the flag by using grep command properly . We used grep command for pico and it searched the text pattern in the file and we found the flag.
Problem solved.

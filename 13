The Problem will provide you an encrypted part.which is 
cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz} 
1.So,we can see if we just apply rot13 to decrypt it .
2.To apply rot13, go to < https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher >
3.Then,paste the encrypted part in the ciphertext. Decrypt it.
4.Thus,you will get your key in the results.Problem solved.
